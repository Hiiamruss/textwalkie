    <h3>How to use Walkie-Talkie?</h3>
    <p>Choose a channel from the dropdown. We supply 5 public servers with one developer server.</p>
    <p>If you want to communicate with other person, make sure they join the same channel as you.</p>
    <p>Then, enter your name. This will show in the reciever's listner, like, "[yourname] said: [message]"</p>
    <p>Then type in your message at the box below. This will send the message to everyone in the channel you are in. Just like a real walkie talkie!</p>
